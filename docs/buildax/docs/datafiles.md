# BuildAX Data File Format

## CSV 

CSV Format data is logged to files named `LOGxxxxx.TXT` on the SD card when
the logging format is set to plaintext mode. It can also be streamed over the 
serial console and telnet.

A CSV formatted packet from a BuildAX Environment Sensor looks like this:

### Field List

 Field Name     | Data Type                      
 -------------- | -----------
 Date           | YYYY/MM/DD formatted ISO 8601 date of the packet
 Time           | HH:MM:SS formatted time the packet was received at
 Name           | The sensor's name, or its address if none has been assigned
 RSSI           | Received Signal Strength Indication, in dBm
 Type           | Received packet type. See [Packet Types](#packet-types) for full definition
 Sequence No.   | Packet identifier (sensors send packets incrementally)
 Transmit Power | Sensor-configured transmission power in dBm 
 Battery        | Battery level, in millivolts, of the BuildAX sensor
 Humidity       | Relative Humidity (percentage of the saturation vapour pressure)
 Temp           | Temperature in degrees Celsius (Â°C), multiplied by 10.
 Light          | Luminous flux measurement in Lux
 PIR Count      | Activation counts of the Passive Infra-red sensor 
 PIR Energy     | PIR energy last captured
 Switch         | Magnetic switch triggers on the device


### Packet Types

The type of a BuildAX packet indicates its transmission source. Listed here are
the currently defined packet types:

 ID    | Type
 ----- | ------
 0     | Encryption packet type (not seen in CSV output)
 1     | Normal Packet RX'd at sensor transmit interval
 2     | Packet sent when PIR sensor triggered
 3     | Packet sent when Magnetic Switch triggered 

Further packet types will be defined as more types of BuildAX sensor are 
developed. 


## Binary

The binary format can be converted into CSV using the `bax2csv` utility found
in the OpenMovement repository. The utility is designed to compile on most
machines with a Make and GCC environment.

Binary BuildAX packets are 32 bytes long. The layout of the binary packet is 
similar to how it is rendered in CSV. The data type widths for an ENV sensor 
are described below:

The data portion of the packet (darkest part in the diagram) is the part which
will vary depending on the packet type. This diagram shows a packet from a 
BuildAX environment sensor (types 1,2,3), which would vary with (for example)
a CO2 sensor.

## Other Files

There are a number of different files on the SD card which are used by the LRS:

 * `BAX_INFO.BIN`
    + This binary file contains 16-byte long entries for each sensor paired
      with the LRS. Contains the encryption key (5 bytes), and the name of each
      sensor (11 bytes).
 * `ERRORS.TXT`
    + Error log for the router. Although this file is named "Errors", it is also 
      used for logging a timestamp and reset code each time the router is powered
      on (e.g. reset due to power loss).
 * `DATxxxxx.BIN`
    + Data files containing logged _binary_ sensor data
 * `LOGxxxxx.TXT`
    + Text files containing logged _plaintext_ sensor data
 * `BAX_SURV.BMP`
    + (Specialist option). If the LRS is flashed with a firmware supporting
      radio-survey mode, it will generate this file containing a survey of
      the radio spectrum noise at your location. Note that the router is not
      currently distributed with this firmware as it is a specialist option.
