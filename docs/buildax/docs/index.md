# BuildAX Documentation

The BuildAX family of wireless monitoring devices comprises of sensors, 
actuators and a logger/router made available under an open license. The devices
were developed within a joint research project undertaken by Newcastle 
University's [Digital Interaction Group](http://di.ncl.ac.uk/) and 
[Sir Joseph Swan Centre for Energy Research](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/energy/)
and Strathclyde University’s [Energy Systems Research Unit](http://www.strath.ac.uk/esru/), 

The devices can be rapidly deployed to enable low cost built environment 
monitoring, and are fully compatible with the Open Source 
[EnTrak™](http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Programs/EnTrak.htm) system as a means 
to deploy ‘eServices’ for systems conditions monitoring, occupant feedback, 
performance certification and the like.
