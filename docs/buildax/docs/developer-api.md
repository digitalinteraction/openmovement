# BuildAX LRS Developer API

The BuildAX LRS can be programatically configured via a remote connection. API calls to the BuildAX LRS are made as RESTful HTTP requests. For you, 
this means that setting state on the LRS is performed via `POST` requests, 
and `GET` requests are used to retrieve data.

The examples in this document use the `wget` command to communicate with the 
web server on the BuildAX LRS. On Linux `wget` is usually installed by default,
but can be downloaded for other OSes (including MacOSX and Windows) from the 
[GNU website](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/).

An equivalent software with much the same functionality as wget is `curl`, 
which may be used in preference to `wget`.


## Logging In

The Web API uses a unique session key (a _cookie_) to authenticate users. All 
API sessions start when this session key is requested by making a POST request
to the BuildAX LRS.

The user agent must first authenticate with the LRS and obtain a session
cookie before further REST API requests can be made:

Method | Resource       | Parameters | Response
------ | -------------- | ---------- | ----------
`POST` | /WWW/login.htm | user, pass | 303 redirect with SID= session cookie.


Example `wget` command (a backslash is used to separate the command onto 
multiple lines):

````
	wget --save-cookies cookies.txt \
		--delete-after \
		--no-http-keep-alive \
		--post-data 'user=admin&pass=password' \
		--keep-session-cookies \
		http://your-bax/WWW/login.htm
````

Equivalent `curl` command:

````
	curl --silent --output /dev/null \
        -c cookies.txt \
        --data 'user=admin&pass=password' \
        http://your-bax/WWW/login.htm
````

## Changing Settings

Settings are passed to the server in the same format as the text command mode.
Please refer to the [LRS commands](commands-lrs.md#settings) for a full description
of the settings commands which may be sent to the LRS. 

Settings can be concatenated with an ampersand (&) in the POST body to change 
multiple settings simultaneously. 


Method | Resource           | Parameters                                      | Response 
------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------
`POST` | /WWW/a\_settng.htm | Setting arguments in the format specified above | `200 OK` Set-Cookie: update=ok 


	wget --load-cookies cookies.txt \
		--post-data 'setting.usb.stream=0' \
		http://your-bax/WWW/a\_settng.htm

Valid settings types are: `file`, `usb`, `telnet`, and `udp`.


## Fetching Data

Data fetching is performed via GET request, so parameters are passed in the
URL.

	http://your-bax/fetch?type=BT&start=449622000&end=485434800

There are three parameters in a fetch request: a type, and the start/end range
specifiers.

Method | Resource | Valid Parameters | Response 
------ | -------- | ---------------- | ----------
`GET`  | `/fetch` | type, start, end | `200 OK` (and download) 


### Fetch Types

The **type** parameter may be specified as one of the following:

 Type | Fetch mode
 ---- | ------------
 BT   | Binary / Time range fetch
 TT   | Text / Time
 BF   | Binary / File
 TF   | Text / File
 BS   | Binary / Sample range _(note: text/sample range is not implemented)_
 LS   | Last N Samples _(note: specify an empty 'end' parameter with this request)_


### Fetch Parameters

The parameters **start** and **end** are always present, but their value
changes based on the type of request.

 Fetch Type        | Range specifiers
 ----------------- | ------------------
**Time Range**     | Start and end are specified in _seconds after the epoch 2000-01-01_ matching the RTC timestamp
**File Range**     | Start and end are data file numbers as stored on the external flash card storage
**Sample Range**   | Start and end are a range of packets numbers received from the sensors
**Last N Samples** | Start is the number of most recent samples. Specify end as an empty string.

### Time Format

To calculate the time range, take the Unix timestamp for the time required (a
standard time representation) and subtract the Unix timestamp for the date
`2000-01-01`. Eg:

````
	Current Unix Time – (2000-01-01 00:00) = BuildAX RTC Timestamp
	       1407940334 –      946684800     = 461255534
````

The reason for this difference is that the hardware real-time-clock (RTC) on
the BuildAX LRS works with an epoch of the year 2000 and a 32-bit timestamp,
meaning dates up to 2068 can be represented internally.

## Example `wget` commands

<span class="alert alert-info"> 
**Login:**
Remember that you must first run the [Login](#logging-in) command to get a
session cookie!
</span>

Get data file 0 from the SD card (no more than 5 files (10MB) may be requested in one download):

	wget --load-cookies cookies.txt \
		--no-http-keep-alive \
		--content-disposition \
		http://your-bax/fetch?type=BF\&start=0\&end=0

Get last 500 samples:

	wget --load-cookies cookies.txt \
		--no-http-keep-alive \
		--content-disposition \
		http://your-bax/fetch?type=LS&start=500&end=

Get data within a time range:

	wget --load-cookies cookies.txt \
		--no-http-keep-alive \
		--content-disposition \
		http://your-bax/fetch?type=BT\&start=449622000\&end=485434800


One possible 'gotcha' is that the ampersand (&) symbol has a special meaning
in most command terminals, and must be escaped with a backslash (as in the 
above examples) so that the command is not forked.

## Generic Commands
In addition to the commands listed above, some commands listed in the 
[LRS Commands](#commands-lrs) section can be sent using this interface.

Method | Resource | Valid Parameters | Response 
------ | -------- | ---------------- | ----------
`POST` | `/cmd`   | LRS command      | `200 OK` (even if the command failed)

A specific limitation of this HTTP interface is that it is not currently
possible to include feedback from this command in the HTTP response. The
server will return the response code, along with an empty response body. This
means that commands (e.g. `status`) which are only useful for their response
will not be useful to call through this interface. Commands which perform 
some action (e.g. `save`) are the use case for this feature.

Example:

	http://your-bax/cmd?save

Additionally, HTTP special characters will not be parsed correctly until 
firmware v1.4. This will make it possible to set the RTC time via the REST
interface.
