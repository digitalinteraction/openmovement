# UDP

Here is an example with commands used to determine the state of the UDP stream,
enable it, and set it to binary mode:

````
>	setting.udp.stream
	Udp:
	Mode: 0
	Setting: Turned off

>	setting.udp.stream=1
	Udp:
	Mode: 0
	Setting: Turned on

>	setting.udp.mode=1
	Udp:
	Mode: 1
	Setting: Turned on
