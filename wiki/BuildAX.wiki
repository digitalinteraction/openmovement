#summary Open Movement BuildAX Building Monitoring

= Open Movement - BuildAX Building Monitoring =

The BuildAX wireless sensors measure building environment/occupancy and include temperature, humidity, light and movement.

The BuildAX family of sensors, actuators and a logger/router are made available under an open license.  The devices were developed within a joint research project undertaken by Newcastle University's Digital Interaction Group and Sir Joseph Swan Centre for Energy Research and Strathclyde University's Energy Systems Research Unit.

The devices can be rapidly deployed to enable low cost built environment monitoring, and are fully compatible with the Open Source EnTrak(tm) system as a means to deploy 'eServices' for systems conditions monitoring, occupant feedback, performance certification and the like.
